#### Team Rules

The key to our teamâ€™s working culture would be transparency. The atmosphere where each member can express his/her thoughts and communicate open-mindedly is ensured. Scrum master makes sure that members are informed of important issues and changes in timely manner.

Communications
  * Daily online discussion if any team member encounters technical issues (Messenger)
  * Weekly in-person discussion with TAs during tutorials
  * Weekly in-person or online meeting with partners depending on their time schedule
    The progress of the project will be presented to the partner during the meeting in forms of screenshots and demonstration.

Meetings
  The scrum master is the moderator for internal meetings who will keep track of attendance of the team and discuss with absent members all details about the group activities. 

Conflict Resolution
  * Indecisions
    - Analyze the issue in advance as a group to make sure every member understands the underlying concept.
    - Brainstorm all possible solutions and analyze the pros and cons of each alternative.
    - A voting will be held and the option chosen by the majority will be our final decision.
  * Non-responsive team members
    - Send messages directly to them and contact the member who is closest to them.
    - Address conversations in a private manner to find out if the member has any personal issues, and offer help as a team if any support is needed.
  * Members keep missing deadline
    - Lower the workload assigned to the member.
    - Depending on the level of the difficulty of the task, give a reasonable extension on deadline.
    - Redistribute the roles and responsibilities to other members who have capability to support.
  * Digressions and tangents
    - Product manager communicates with the partner to find out if there is room for flexibility.
    - Negotiate with the partner to adjust the direction of the project in case the objective is not aligned with the original goal.

#### Events

<!-- Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:
 * When and where? Recurring or ad hoc? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync meeting online, etc. -->
Weekly goal will be set during the meeting in tutorial time. Modification of the goal and measurement of actions will be continuously discussed and monitored through daily online discussion. The process of the project and accountability of each member for attending meeting is discussed in Communications and Conflict Resolution section.

We have three weekly meetings:

Monday at tutorial room
  * Check the progress of the weekly plan (how much of the weekly goal is completed, what needs to be improved, etc.)
  * Set up plan/goal for the coming week

Thursday 4-5 pm at the study room we booked. During that time, two meetings will be held:
  * Partner meeting
    - Report the progress and discuss continuously on the project requirements or modifications on specifications
  * Internal group meeting (followed after the partner meeting)
    - Understand and interpret needs of the partner
    - Discuss any issues regarding the weekly plan for the group and derive solutions/modifications if needed
    - Assign weekly goals for individual members

In addition, we have three events:

* Coding sessions
  - Every weekend in-person at the study room we booked
  - Attendance is not required, members can choose to come if they do not have other deadlines to work on.
  - Ensure more smooth workflow between front-end and back-end development. Both teams can communicate and make agreement on what information needs to be sent and retrieved in order to minimize amount of data transfer.
  - Since certain tasks are planned to be done in a small subgroup of two or three assigned members, working together provides them an opportunity to better divide tasks among themselves based on each one's own strength and weakness. 

* Code reviews
  - Ad hoc, online
  - When a member finishes implementing a specific feature, that member will ask another member in the team to test the functionality of the feature, its consistency with the original requirement, and potential bugs that may occur.
  - If any improvement needs to be addressed, the member will fix the problem based on the feedback from the other member. After fixing, they will go through another round of the review process until the feature is ready to be pushed to the master branch.

* Ongoing adjustments
  - Online group messenger (weChat)
  - As group memebers work on to achieve weekly target, there might be potential issues that require immediate modification in implementation or weekly goal. These issues will be ongoingly monitored and discussed through online group messenger. 
  - If immediate change in the direction of the project is needed, additional group meeting will be scheduled with priority. The decisions on minor issues will be made through the group chat.

#### Artifacts

<!-- List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

* Artifacts can be To-Do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
* We want to understand:
  * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
  * How do you prioritize tasks?
  * How do tasks get assigned to team members? -->
* To-do lists, Taskboards, Issue Tracker
  - We are using Trello for managing weekly workload, assigning work to team members, and tracking issues. Trello provides a digital board which is highly customizable, and it helps us to list our unfinished tasks, finished tasks, and identify tasks needed to be reviewed. We will organize the work based on scrum principles and prioritize certain tasks based on partner needs.

* Communication
  - WeChat as the primary communication of team. This is where we discuss immediate issues that require prioritized decision making or anything that was not covered in the in-person meetings.

#### Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.
<!-- 
 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and why
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!
 -->

Before we started writing everything, we had a group meeting first to split our team into subgroups working for individual categories. Specifically, to keep everyone on track, we have at least two persons working on the same category. We also had the persons working on the same part of our project sitting besides each other for communication once we started coding.

We split our project into three parts:
1) Front-end(Fabric) Members: Junkai, Jae and Zhifan
Junkai, Jae and Frank worked on building our FBC application page, which users put stickies on the fabric for their canvas.
2) Front-end(Log in and Library) Members: Xuhui and Xinyi
Xuhui and Xinyi worked on building registration, log in and profile page, as well as the library page for users/managers to move/manage to other canvas projects that they are participating in, if applicable.
3) Back-end Members: Fanxuan and Luya
Fanxuan and Luya worked on back-end programming such as storing user and canvas information, munipulating and sending information when our website need it.

We split our work this way so that not too many members are working on the same parts of our project which helped us avoid having conflicts on our code. We also create sub-branches for our functionality which would be explained below.

* Sub-branches for each funtionality (front-end, back-end)
  - Front-end: profile, canvas+fabric, fabric_experiment, canvas-apapt-ejs
  profile: 
  sign up, log in page, as well as editing user's information.
  canvas+fabric:
  the fbc application page(main), and also the library page.
  fabric_experiement:
  the branch where we were testing how fabric.js worked and showed our partner our progress on the project.
  canvas-adapt-ejs:
  the branch where we adapt our canvas page to ejs for the back end.
  back-end:
  the branch where all back end codes are done.

We started our project by having profile, canvas+fabric and back-end, three branches, excluding the master.
Then, for testing purpose, we create the sub-branch of canvas+fabric, the fabric_experiment. After we merged canvas+fabric and fabric_experiment together, we started a new branch called canvas-adpat-ejs for adapting ejs for the connections of our front end and back end.
We then merged canvas-adapt-ejs back to canvas+fabric, and merged profile and master together. Later, we merged canvas+fabric to our master branch and finally we added backend to master as well to finish our deliverable.

We chose this workflow because we effictively avoided conflits by the fact that it was easy for any team members to know what other team members are writing since only one or two memembers are on the same team.

For deployment tools, we have node.js for local and heroku for online. 
We used node.js becasuse our project does not have intensive operations but only connections between server and clients. node.js as a platform that is capable of handling a huge number of simultaneous connections suited for our need.
We used heroku not only because it is widely poupular but also the fact that it is easy to set up, we only had to push and commit our codes to our heroku git repository. 


## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

Goal:
Ouf main goal is to build a website where users can access and work on their FBCs online.

Tasks(Ranking from the most important to the least):
1) Building the FBC application page
To allow users to access virtual FBC, the most important task is to build the FBC application page which allows user to perform all options such as, adding, removing stickies to the canvas

2) Building the library page
To let users who are participating in multiple FBCs be able to edit all of their work.

3) Connections between server and clients
To be able to manage our website, allow users to work on the FBC at the same time, and modify their password etc.

4) User profile page
To change basic information of users' profile.



#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.


Sticky auto positioning:
Once users create a new sticky, it can be dragged under any categories of the canvas. Futhermore, we had created an auto positioning function which automatically fixes a sticky's position to be within one of its closest category if it was put in the middle of two categories, to avoid confusion and save time for users to organize the canvas.

Search function(Sticky hashtag):
We created a search function on our main application page for the ease of finding a specific sticky that a user wants. In addition, we propose user to add hashtags once they finish writing a sticky so that they can search for stickies with the exact hashtags which helps them find the content that they need even easier.

Library:
We created a library page for users to easily access multiple FBCs at the same time. Compared to real life FBCs, having a library page on our webisite is much more efficient.

Comment:
We implemented comment system under each stikies so that valuable disscussions can be stored in the stikies if needed. This is hard to accomplish in real life FBCs thus it presents our project idea. 

Export Import:
We implemented export and import function which allow users to continue their previous unfinished FBCs or save their current FBC offline. 

Zooming:
We allow users to zoom in or out their FBCs which will allow them to focus on individual categories or have a look at the full view.

Text auto fitting:
We allow users to enlarge or reduce the size of stikies, when doing so, the text inside the stikies will automatically change its size accordingly.
