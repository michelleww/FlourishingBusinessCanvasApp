#### Team Rules

The key to our team's working culture would be transparency. The atmosphere where each member can express his/her thoughts and communicate open-mindedly is ensured. Scrum master makes sure that members are informed of important issues and changes in timely manner.

Communications
  * Daily online discussion if any team member encounters technical issues (Messenger)
  * Weekly in-person discussion with TAs during tutorials
  * Weekly in-person or online meeting with partners depending on their time schedule
    The progress of the project will be presented to the partner during the meeting in forms of screenshots and demonstration.

Meetings
  The scrum master is the moderator for internal meetings who will keep track of attendance of the team and discuss with absent members all details about the group activities. 

Conflict Resolution
  * Indecisions
    - Analyze the issue in advance as a group to make sure every member understands the underlying concept.
    - Brainstorm all possible solutions and analyze the pros and cons of each alternative.
    - A voting will be held and the option chosen by the majority will be our final decision.
  * Non-responsive team members
    - Send messages directly to them and contact the member who is closest to them.
    - Address conversations in a private manner to find out if the member has any personal issues, and offer help as a team if any support is needed.
  * Members keep missing deadline
    - Lower the workload assigned to the member.
    - Depending on the level of the difficulty of the task, give a reasonable extension on deadline.
    - Redistribute the roles and responsibilities to other members who have capability to support.
  * Digressions and tangents
    - Product manager communicates with the partner to find out if there is room for flexibility.
    - Negotiate with the partner to adjust the direction of the project in case the objective is not aligned with the original goal.

#### Events

Weekly goal will be set during the meeting in tutorial time. Modification of the goal and measurement of actions will be continuously discussed and monitored through daily online discussion. The process of the project and accountability of each member for attending meeting is discussed in Communications and Conflict Resolution sections.

We have three weekly meetings:

Monday at tutorial room
  * Check the progress of the weekly plan (how much of the weekly goal is completed, what needs to be improved, etc.)
  * Set up plan/goal for the coming week

Thursday 4-5 pm at the study room we booked. During that time, two meetings will be held:
  * Partner meeting
    - Report the progress and discuss continuously on the project requirements or modifications on specifications
  * Internal group meeting (followed after the partner meeting)
    - Understand and interpret needs of the partner
    - Discuss any issues regarding the weekly plan for the group and derive solutions/modifications if needed
    - Assign weekly goals for individual members

In addition, we have three events:

* Coding sessions
  - Every weekend in-person at the study room we booked
  - Attendance is not required, members can choose to come if they do not have other deadlines to work on.
  - Ensure more smooth workflow between front-end and back-end development. Both teams can communicate and make agreement on what information needs to be sent and retrieved in order to minimize amount of data transfer.
  - Since certain tasks are planned to be done in a small subgroup of two or three assigned members, working together provides them an opportunity to better divide tasks among themselves based on each one's own strength and weakness. 

* Code reviews
  - Ad hoc, online
  - When a member finishes implementing a specific feature, that member will ask another member in the team to test the functionality of the feature, its consistency with the original requirement, and potential bugs that may occur.
  - If any improvement needs to be addressed, the member will fix the problem based on the feedback from the other member. After fixing, they will go through another round of the review process until the feature is ready to be pushed to the master branch.

* Ongoing adjustments
  - Online group messenger (WeChat)
  - As group memebers work on to achieve weekly target, there might be potential issues that require immediate modification in implementation or weekly goal. These issues will be ongoingly monitored and discussed through online group messenger. 
  - If immediate change in the direction of the project is needed, additional group meeting will be scheduled with priority. The decisions on minor issues will be made through the group chat.

#### Artifacts

* To-do lists, Taskboards, Issue Tracker
  - We are using Trello for managing weekly workload, assigning work to team members, and tracking issues. Trello provides a digital board which is highly customizable, and it helps us to list our unfinished tasks, finished tasks, and identify tasks needed to be reviewed. We will organize the work based on scrum principles and prioritize certain tasks based on partner needs.

* Communication
  - WeChat as the primary communication of team. This is where we discuss immediate issues that require prioritized decision-making or anything that was not covered in the in-person meetings.

#### Deployment and Github Workflow

Before we started the actual coding, we had a group meeting to split our team into subgroups, each working on one major part of the project (the breakdown is detailed below). To ensure the completeness of each part within the desired time, we have at least two people working on the same category so that they can reach out and offer help to one another.

We split our project into three parts:
1) Front-end(Fabric) Members: Junkai, Jay, and Frank
Junkai, Jae, and Frank worked on building the FBC application page, where users put stickies onto the virtual canvas.
2) Front-end(User pages) Members: Xuhui and Xinyi
Xuhui and Xinyi worked on building registration, log in, user profile, as well as the library page for users/managers to keep track of and access all canvas projects that they have participated in, if applicable.
3) Back-end Members: Fanxuan and Luya
Fanxuan and Luya worked on back-end development to receive data sent from the front-end, interpret the meaning of the data, manipulate the data to get relevant information that needs to be updated on the database, and send data back to the front-end for displaying purposes.
Our database is designed to store user information, canvas information, and the relationship between users and canvases.

We split our work this way so that not too many members are working on the same part of our project which helps us avoid conflicts on our code as well as maximize efficiency.

We create sub-branches on Git based on the functionality for tracking purpose which is explained below.

* Front-end
  - ProfilePageDev
	sign up page, log in page, and user profile page including ejs and css for each
  - canvas+fabric
	user library page including ejs and css, and FBC canvas page
  - fabric_experiment
	for testing how fabric.js works and showing our partner the intermediate progress on the project
  - canvas-adapt-ejs
	for adapting the FBC canvas page to ejs version
  
* Back-end
  - backend
	back-end files, database, and other merged front-end pages in ejs version for testing the correctness of whether front-end and back-end are linked properly

We started our project by having ProfilePageDev, canvas+fabric, and backend, three branches, excluding the master.

Then, for testing purpose, we created a sub-branch of canvas+fabric, the fabric_experiment. After we merged canvas+fabric and fabric_experiment together, we started a new sub-branch called canvas-adapt-ejs for converting from original vanilla js to ejs version in order to make connections between front-end and back-end.
We then merged canvas-adapt-ejs back to canvas+fabric.

After that, we merged ProfilePageDev and master together as it was completed first. Later, we merged canvas+fabric to our master branch. And finally we added backend to master and it indicated the finish of our deliverable 2.

For deployment tools, we have node.js for local and heroku for online. 
We use node.js because our project does not have intensive operations but only connections between server and clients. Node.js as a platform that is capable of handling a huge number of simultaneous connections best suits for our need.
We use heroku not only because it is widely popular but also the fact that it is easy to set up by simply pushing our codes to the heroku git repository. 


## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

Goal:
Ouf main goal is to build a website where users can access and work on their FBCs online.

Tasks(Ranking from the most important to the least):
1) Building the FBC application page
To allow users to access virtual FBC, the most important task is to build the FBC application page which allows user to perform all options such as, adding, removing stickies to the canvas

2) Building the library page
To let users who are participating in multiple FBCs be able to edit all of their work.

3) Connections between server and clients
To be able to manage our website, allow users to work on the FBC at the same time, and modify their password etc.

4) User profile page
To change basic information of users' profile.



#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.


Sticky auto positioning:
Once users create a new sticky, it can be dragged under any categories of the canvas. Futhermore, we had created an auto positioning function which automatically fixes a sticky's position to be within one of its closest category if it was put in the middle of two categories, to avoid confusion and save time for users to organize the canvas.

Search function(Sticky hashtag):
We created a search function on our main application page for the ease of finding a specific sticky that a user wants. In addition, we propose user to add hashtags once they finish writing a sticky so that they can search for stickies with the exact hashtags which helps them find the content that they need even easier.

Library:
We created a library page for users to easily access multiple FBCs at the same time. Compared to real life FBCs, having a library page on our webisite is much more efficient.

Comment:
We implemented comment system under each stikies so that valuable disscussions can be stored in the stikies if needed. This is hard to accomplish in real life FBCs thus it presents our project idea. 

Export Import:
We implemented export and import function which allow users to continue their previous unfinished FBCs or save their current FBC offline. 

Zooming:
We allow users to zoom in or out their FBCs which will allow them to focus on individual categories or have a look at the full view.

Text auto fitting:
We allow users to enlarge or reduce the size of stikies, when doing so, the text inside the stikies will automatically change its size accordingly.
