#### Team Rules

The key to our teamâ€™s working culture would be transparency. The atmosphere where each member can express his/her thoughts and communicate open-mindedly is ensured. Scrum master makes sure that members are informed of important issues and changes in timely manner.

Communications
  * Daily online discussion if any team member encounters technical issues (Messenger)
  * Weekly in-person discussion with TAs during tutorials
  * Weekly in-person or online meeting with partners depending on their time schedule
    The progress of the project will be presented to the partner during the meeting in forms of screenshots and demonstration.

Meetings
  The scrum master is the moderator for internal meetings who will keep track of attendance of the team and discuss with absent members all details about the group activities.

Conflict Resolution
  * Indecisions
    - Analyze the issue in advance as a group to make sure every member understands the underlying concept.
    - Brainstorm all possible solutions.
    - A voting will be held and the option chosen by the majority will be our final decision.
  * Non-responsive team members
    - Send messages directly to them and contact the member who is closest to them.
    - Address conversations in a private manner to find out if the member has any personal issues, and offer help as a team if any support is needed.
  * Members keep missing deadline
    - Lower the workload assigned to the member.
    - Depending on the evaluation of the difficulty of the task, give a reasonable extension on deadline.
    - Redistribute the roles and responsibilities to other members who have capacity to support.
  * Digressions and tangents
    - Product manager communicates with the partner to find out if there is room for flexibility.
    - Negotiate with the partner to adjust the direction of the project in case the objective is not aligned with the original goal.

#### Events

<!-- Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:
 * When and where? Recurring or ad hoc? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync meeting online, etc. -->

We have three weekly meetings:

Monday at tutorial room
  * Check the progress of the weekly plan (how much of the weekly goal is completed, what needs to be improved, etc.)
  * Set up plan/goal for the coming week

Thursday 4-5 pm at the study room we booked. During that time, two meetings will be held:
  * Partner meeting
    - Report the progress and discuss continuously on the project requirements or modifications on specifications
  * Internal group meeting (followed after the partner meeting)
    - Understand and interpret needs of the partner
    - Discuss any issues regarding the weekly plan for the group and derive solutions/modifications if needed
    - Assign weekly goals for individual members

In addition, we have two events:

* Coding sessions
  - Every weekend in-person at the study room we booked
  - Attendance is not required, members can choose to come if they do not have other deadlines to work on.
  - Ensure more smooth workflow between front-end and back-end development. Both teams can communicate and make agreement on what information needs to be sent and retrieved in order to minimize amount of data transfer.
  - Since certain tasks are planned to be done in a small subgroup of two or three assigned members, working together provides them an opportunity to better divide tasks among themselves based on each one's own strength and weakness. 

* Code reviews
  - Ad hoc, online
  - When a member finishes implementing a specific feature, that member will ask another member in the team to test the functionality of the feature, its consistency with the original requirement, and potential bugs that may occur.
  - If any improvement needs to be addressed, the member will fix the problem based on the feedback from the other member. After fixing, they will go through another round of the review process until the feature is ready to be pushed to the master branch.

#### Artifacts

<!-- List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

* Artifacts can be To-Do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
* We want to understand:
  * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
  * How do you prioritize tasks?
  * How do tasks get assigned to team members? -->

We are using Trello for managing weekly workload, assigning work to team members, and tracking issues. Trello provides a digital board which is highly customizable, and it helps us to list our unfinished tasks, finished tasks, and identify tasks needed to be reviewed. We will organize the work based on scrum principles and prioritize certain tasks based on partner needs.

#### Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and why
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
