#### Team Rules

The key to our teamâ€™s working culture would be transparency. The atmosphere where each member can express his/her thoughts and communicate open-mindedly is ensured. Scrum master makes sure that members are informed of important issues and changes in timely manner.

Communications
  * Daily online discussion if any team member encounters technical issues (Messenger)
  * Weekly in-person discussion with TAs during tutorials
  * Weekly in-person or online meeting with partners depending on their time schedule
    The progress of the project will be presented to the partner during the meeting in forms of screenshots and demonstration.

Meetings
  The scrum master is the moderator for internal meetings who will keep track of attendance of the team and discuss with absent members all details about the group activities.

Conflict Resolution
  * Indecisions
    - Analyze the issue in advance as a group to make sure every member understands the underlying concept.
    - Brainstorm all possible solutions.
    - A voting will be held and the option chosen by the majority will be our final decision.
  * Non-responsive team members
    - Send messages directly to them and contact the member who is closest to them.
    - Address conversations in a private manner to find out if the member has any personal issues, and offer help as a team if any support is needed.
  * Members keep missing deadline
    - Lower the workload assigned to the member.
    - Depending on the evaluation of the difficulty of the task, give a reasonable extension on deadline.
    - Redistribute the roles and responsibilities to other members who have capacity to support.
  * Digressions and tangents
    - Product manager communicates with the partner to find out if there is room for flexibility.
    - Negotiate with the partner to adjust the direction of the project in case the objective is not aligned with the original goal.

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:
 * When and where? Recurring or ad hoc? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync meeting online, etc.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

* Artifacts can be To-Do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
* We want to understand:
  * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
  * How do you prioritize tasks?
  * How do tasks get assigned to team members?

#### Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and why
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
