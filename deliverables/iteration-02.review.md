# Flourishing Business Canvas / Team 09

## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Mar 9, 2019
 * Where: BA3185

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

**Having a group meeting for outlining features to be implemented and discussing schemas prior to any coding actually starts: **

Before we started writing anything, we had a group meeting and used the app called "Trello" for keeping track of the meeting. In Trello, we listed the tasks that we targeted to finish during deliverable 2 and specified subtasks under each. Then we wrote out what data we should store for our schemas.

This decision turned out to be successful because during the month of February, most of us had a lot of midterms and deadlines, therefore we could not get much chance to meet the whole team. However, because we had written most information and tasks needed for deliverable 2 on "Trello", our team was heading the right direction for completing our project. All members had a sense of what they needed to accomplish and the expected amount of work to be done so that they could plan ahead and start out if they had spare time.

**Having 2 to 3 members on each sub groups to work on our project: **

We splited our group members into 3 teams: Front end(Canvas), Front end(User pages) and Back end.

This decision was effective because not only we were able to follow up the project progress by communicating within the subgroups, we also reduced the chance of conflicting issues since each team had at most 3 people working on it.

**Working in the same room for the ease of communicating between front end and back end teams: **

We chose to work on the project with all members in-person at the end of deliverable 2. 

This decision turned out to be successful because we were able to communicate between front end and back end directly about how data would be fetched, stored, and sent. Both teams quickly made adjustments to ensure the correctness of data transfer between pages.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

**We planned too much ahead: **

Although we did finish in the end, we had planned to write too much for deliverable 2. If we take a look back at how we planned for deliverable 2, we implemented many additional helper functions which were not a part of the intial plan such as sticky search, auto positioning and comment system as these functions were beyond the partner requirements of the FBC. 

This decision did not turn out as well as we hoped because the overwhelming amount of tasks made us not know where to start the project or where to focus on so the beginning phase of D2 was a quite slow process.

**Front end and back end did not use the same version of JavaScript at the beginning: **

Our front end teams started writing their code using vanilla js, while the back end team wrote the code based on ejs. This was a miscommunication and turned out that all front end pages had to be rewritten and switched to ejs version in order to successfully connect front and back end together. This was time-consuming and hugely slowed down our development progress.


#### Planned changes

We will change the frequency of meeting our partner from once per week to once per two weeks. Since the progress we made per week during deliverable 2 was not enough for a meeting.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

**Main FBC canvas page**

We finished implementing our FBC canvas page with all functionalities that a physical canvas is capable of, plus some additional functions that are used to better serve user needs and help them to organize their canvas, such as:

Sticky auto positioning, Search function, Comment, Export Import, Zooming, Text auto fitting, as mentioned in our plan.md.

**User library page**

We finished implementing our library page which users can get access to all of their FBCs that they have participated in.

**Sign up, log in, user profile, and reset password pages**

We finished implementing our sign up and log in pages, where users can register and log in. There is also a profile page where users can modify their basic information including name, phone, company, and occupation. As well as a reset password page for users to modify their credentials.


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

**Admin page (email invitation)**

When we initially had the meeting with our partner, we planned that we should have an admin page for our partner where he can send invitation to users so they can have access to our website. As well as functionalities such as manage users, canvases and search. However, as deliverable 2 went on we thought that admin page is not part of the basic functionalities of FBC. Therefore we decide to postpone it to deliverable 3.

**Weekly meeting with Andrew**

We initially planned that we should meet Andrew once per week to show our work. However, due to the slow progress we made in the early February, we cancelled some of the meetings.


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are(from the most to least important):

**Multiple users synchronization**

Users will be able to access the same FBC at the same time and changes made on one canvas will be synchronized real-time through all canvases.

**Admin page (email invitation)**

Admin will be able to send invitations for users to have access to our website. Whoever receives the email is identified as a manager who is given the power to create canvases and invite others to work on their canvases.

Basic admin functionalities will be implemented such as manage users, canvases and possibly search for a particular sticky not only within a single canvas but also across all canvases if necessary.
 

**Edit history for each sticky**

Edit history will be added to the sticky, users will be able to view how a sticky progressed.
