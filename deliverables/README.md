**Log in/Sign up page**

This is the first page users will reach in our website. 

Our website is designed to be a private page, therefore, a user should receive our partner(admin)'s invitation email in order to sign up for an account. 

For testing purposes, enter 22@q as email with password 123 will log in to a regular user page.

Enter h@p as email and magic as password will log in to a manager page.

**Library page(Manager)**

Click any FBC shown under the header will direct user to the main canvas page of a specific FBC.

On the right side of the header there are three buttons, **Manage users**, **Manage canvas** and **Profile**.

By clicking **Manage users**, a list of canvases that the manager has currently, as well as the users of each canvas will be shown in the pop up window. Manager can **add** users to any canvas by clicking the add button under a specific canvas and enter their emails, or **remove** users from a canvas by checking the username boxes under that canvas and clicking remove.

By clicking **Manage canvas**, manager can **add** a new canvas by entering the title of the new canvas, or **remove** a previous canvas by checking the canvas name box and clicking on the remove button.

By clicking **Profile**, manager will be moved to the profile page.
 

**Library page(User)**

All functionalities are the same as **Library page(Manager)** except that a regular user cannot manage other users or canvases. 

**Profile page**

Users can modify their information in this page and click **Save changes** for it to take effect. However, email cannot be changed.

When clicking **Want to change password?**, users can change password by entering their old and new passwords. Only if old password matches with previous record and new password aligns with the confirm password, the password is then successfully changed. 

**Main FBC application page**

When users are successfully logged in to our website, through the library page they will be able to move to the canvas page.

Besides the arrow button, we have an input box where users can enter the content they want and create a new sticky by pressing the "**New Sticky**" button.

Once a sticky is created, users can drag it to their desired boxes. The sticky will automatically positioned meaning if it is dragged to the middle of two boxes, it will be moved in to the box that is the closest to it.

User can also **double click** a sticky to modify its **color**, **content**, add **comment** or **delete** it entirely.

Additionally, when user **single click** a sticky, under the header they will be an extra box displaying all the stickies under the box where the current selected sticky is in. This is useful when there are too many stickies in a box.

Furthermore, on the right side of the header, users can input the **first name** and **last name** of the creator of this page, **export** the FBC and **search** within the canvas. For now, search function can only display the stickies that has the keyword under the search bar but not able to transition to them.
