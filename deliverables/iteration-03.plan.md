# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 >
 > > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration 03

 * Start date: Mar 24, 2019
 * End date: Mar 31, 2019

## Process

#### Changes from previous iteration

List the most significant changes you made to your process (if any).

 * At most 3 items
 * Start with the most significant change
 * For each change, explain why you are making it and what you are hoping to achieve from it
 * Ideally, for each change, you will define a clear success metric (i.e. something you can measure at the end of the iteration to determine whether the change you made was successful)

 > *Note:* If you are not making any changes to your process, it means that you are happy with all of the decisions you made in the previous iterations.
 >
 > > In this case, list what you consider to be the most significant process decisions your team made. For each decision, explain why you consider it successful, and what success metric you are using (or could use) to assert that the decision is successful.

We are happy with all of our decisions made in the previous iterations. The list of the most significant process decisions made by our team are listed below:

**Using the kanban methodology**

Throughout our programming process, we chose "Trello" as our mainly used task listing app for listing all the features that we need to finish. Every time a new deliverable started, we held a meeting with all of our team members to decide what we need to finish by the end of the deliverable. Then each of our sub groups started working and checking off the tasks once they had finished. We were really efficient this way in deliverable 2 because even though the list of tasks we listed at the beginning of the meeting might not be entirely accurate or enough, all of our team members had a general idea of what was needed to get done and could add more or edit the tasks to the actual task that we needed to do, if they realized that it was needed as they were coding.

Therefore, we are planning to continue using kanban in deliverable 3.

**Dividing our team into sub groups**

We split our group members into 3 teams in deliverable 2: Front end(Canvas), Front end(User pages) and Back end.

Because of that, not only we were able to follow up the project progress by communicating within the subgroups, we also reduced the chance of conflicting issues since each team had at most 3 people working on it.

Therefore, we are planning to continue working as three subgroups.

**Working in the same room for the ease of communicating between front end and back end teams: **

We chose to work on the project with all members in-person at the end of deliverable 2. 

Because of that, we were able to communicate between front end and back end directly about how data would be fetched, stored, and sent. Both teams quickly made adjustments to ensure the correctness of data transfer between pages.

Therefore, we are planning to continue working in the same room as frequently as possible.

#### Team Rules

Describe your team's working culture.

The key to our team's working culture would be transparency. The atmosphere where each member can express his/her thoughts and communicate open-mindedly is ensured. Scrum master makes sure that members are informed of important issues and changes in timely manner.

Communications

- Daily online discussion if any team member encounters technical issues (Messenger)
- Weekly in-person discussion with TAs during tutorials
- Weekly in-person or online meeting with partners depending on their time schedule
  The progress of the project will be presented to the partner during the meeting in forms of screenshots and demonstration.

Meetings
  The scrum master is the moderator for internal meetings who will keep track of attendance of the team and discuss with absent members all details about the group activities. 

Conflict Resolution

- Indecisions
  - Analyze the issue in advance as a group to make sure every member understands the underlying concept.
  - Brainstorm all possible solutions and analyze the pros and cons of each alternative.
  - A voting will be held and the option chosen by the majority will be our final decision.
- Non-responsive team members
  - Send messages directly to them and contact the member who is closest to them.
  - Address conversations in a private manner to find out if the member has any personal issues, and offer help as a team if any support is needed.
- Members keep missing deadline
  - Lower the workload assigned to the member.
  - Depending on the level of the difficulty of the task, give a reasonable extension on deadline.
  - Redistribute the roles and responsibilities to other members who have capability to support.
- Digressions and tangents
  - Product manager communicates with the partner to find out if there is room for flexibility.
  - Negotiate with the partner to adjust the direction of the project in case the objective is not aligned with the original goal.


#### Events

Weekly goal will be set during the meeting in tutorial time. Modification of the goal and measurement of actions will be continuously discussed and monitored through daily online discussion. The process of the project and accountability of each member for attending meeting is discussed in Communications and Conflict Resolution sections.

We have three weekly meetings:

Monday at tutorial room

- Check the progress of the weekly plan (how much of the weekly goal is completed, what needs to be improved, etc.)
- Set up plan/goal for the coming week

Thursday 4-5 pm at the study room we booked. During that time, two meetings will be held:

- Partner meeting
  - Report the progress and discuss continuously on the project requirements or modifications on specifications
- Internal group meeting (followed after the partner meeting)
  - Understand and interpret needs of the partner
  - Discuss any issues regarding the weekly plan for the group and derive solutions/modifications if needed
  - Assign weekly goals for individual members

In addition, we have three events:

- Coding sessions
  - Every weekend in-person at the study room we booked
  - Attendance is not required, members can choose to come if they do not have other deadlines to work on.
  - Ensure more smooth workflow between front-end and back-end development. Both teams can communicate and make agreement on what information needs to be sent and retrieved in order to minimize amount of data transfer.
  - Since certain tasks are planned to be done in a small subgroup of two or three assigned members, working together provides them an opportunity to better divide tasks among themselves based on each one's own strength and weakness. 
- Code reviews
  - Ad hoc, online
  - When a member finishes implementing a specific feature, that member will ask another member in the team to test the functionality of the feature, its consistency with the original requirement, and potential bugs that may occur.
  - If any improvement needs to be addressed, the member will fix the problem based on the feedback from the other member. After fixing, they will go through another round of the review process until the feature is ready to be pushed to the master branch.
- Ongoing adjustments
  - Online group messenger (WeChat)
  - As group memebers work on to achieve weekly target, there might be potential issues that require immediate modification in implementation or weekly goal. These issues will be ongoingly monitored and discussed through online group messenger. 
  - If immediate change in the direction of the project is needed, additional group meeting will be scheduled with priority. The decisions on minor issues will be made through the group chat.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-Do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?



**To-Do lists, "Trello"**

We are using "Trello" for managing weekly workload, assigning work to team members, and tracking issues. Trello provides a digital board which is highly customizable, and it helps us to list our unfinished tasks, finished tasks, and identify tasks needed to be reviewed. We will organize the work based on scrum principles and prioritize certain tasks based on partner needs.

**Prioritizing tasks**

We will prioritize our tasks when we hold our first meeting once the deliverable started. We will mark the most important tasks and let all of our team members work for them first.

**Assigning tasks to team members**

We split our team into 3 subgroups: Front end(Canvas), Front end(User pages) and Back end.

Each of the subgroups will work on the most important tasks of their part listed in "Trello" and to the least important.




#### Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and why
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!



## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
