# Flourishing Business Canvas/TEAM 9


## Iteration 03

 * Start date: Mar 24, 2019
 * End date: Mar 31, 2019

## Process

#### Changes from previous iteration

We are satisfied with all of our decisions made in the previous iterations. The list of the most significant process decisions made by our team are listed below:

**Using the kanban methodology**

Throughout our programming process in deliverable 2, we chose "Trello" as our mainly used task listing app to organize all the features that we need to implement. Every time a new deliverable started, we held a meeting with all of our team members to decide what we need to finish by the end of the deliverable. Then, each of our sub groups started working and checking off the tasks once they had finished. We were really efficient this way in deliverable 2 because even though the list of tasks we listed at the beginning of the meeting might not be entirely accurate or enough, all of our team members had a general idea of what was needed to get done. Indeed, the members were able to add more tasks or transform abstract tasks to actual concrete tasks in case they discovered additional features required as they were coding.

Therefore, we are planning to continue using kanban in deliverable 3.

**Dividing our team into sub groups**

We split our group members into 3 teams in deliverable 2: Front end(Canvas), Front end(User pages) and Back end.

Because of that, not only were we able to follow up the project progress by communicating within the subgroups, but also reduced the chance of conflicting issues since each team had at most 3 people working on it. Potential conflicts were resolved through active communications among the sub group members.

Therefore, we are planning to continue working as three subgroups.

**Working in the same room for the ease of communicating between front end and back end teams:**

We chose to work on the project with all members in-person at the end of deliverable 2. 

Because of that, we were able to communicate between front end and back end directly about how data would be fetched, stored, and sent. Both teams quickly made adjustments to ensure the correctness of data transfer between pages. Any issues were discussed immediately and decisions were made in timely manner.

Therefore, we are planning to continue working in the same room as frequently as possible.

#### Team Rules

Describe your team's working culture.

The key to our team's working culture would be transparency. The atmosphere where each member can express his/her thoughts and communicate open-mindedly is ensured. Scrum master makes sure that members are informed of important issues and changes in timely manner.

Communications

- Daily online discussion if any team member encounters technical issues (Messenger)
- Weekly in-person discussion with TAs during tutorials
- Weekly in-person or online meeting with partners depending on their time schedule
  The progress of the project will be presented to the partner during the meeting in forms of screenshots and demonstration.

Meetings
  The scrum master is the moderator for internal meetings who will keep track of attendance of the team and discuss with absent members all details about the group activities. 

Conflict Resolution

- Indecisions
  - Analyze the issue in advance as a group to make sure every member understands the underlying concept.
  - Brainstorm all possible solutions and analyze the pros and cons of each alternative.
  - A voting will be held and the option chosen by the majority will be our final decision.
- Non-responsive team members
  - Send messages directly to them and contact the member who is closest to them.
  - Address conversations in a private manner to find out if the member has any personal issues, and offer help as a team if any support is needed.
- Members keep missing deadline
  - Lower the workload assigned to the member.
  - Depending on the level of the difficulty of the task, give a reasonable extension on deadline.
  - Redistribute the roles and responsibilities to other members who have capability to support.
- Digressions and tangents
  - Product manager communicates with the partner to find out if there is room for flexibility.
  - Negotiate with the partner to adjust the direction of the project in case the objective is not aligned with the original goal.


#### Events

Weekly goal will be set during the meeting in tutorial time. Modification of the goal and measurement of actions will be continuously discussed and monitored through daily online discussion. The process of the project and accountability of each member for attending meeting is discussed in Communications and Conflict Resolution sections.

We have three weekly meetings:

Monday at tutorial room

- Check the progress of the weekly plan (how much of the weekly goal is completed, what needs to be improved, etc.)
- Set up plan/goal for the coming week

Thursday 4-5 pm at the study room we booked. During that time, two meetings will be held:

- Partner meeting
  - Report the progress and discuss continuously on the project requirements or modifications on specifications
- Internal group meeting (followed after the partner meeting)
  - Understand and interpret needs of the partner
  - Discuss any issues regarding the weekly plan for the group and derive solutions/modifications if needed
  - Assign weekly goals for individual members

In addition, we have three events:

- Coding sessions
  - Every weekend in-person at the study room we booked
  - Attendance is not required, members can choose to come if they do not have other deadlines to work on.
  - Ensure more smooth workflow between front-end and back-end development. Both teams can communicate and make agreement on what information needs to be sent and retrieved in order to minimize amount of data transfer.
  - Since certain tasks are planned to be done in a small subgroup of two or three assigned members, working together provides them an opportunity to better divide tasks among themselves based on each one's own strength and weakness. 
- Code reviews
  - Ad hoc, online
  - When a member finishes implementing a specific feature, that member will ask another member in the team to test the functionality of the feature, its consistency with the original requirement, and potential bugs that may occur.
  - If any improvement needs to be addressed, the member will fix the problem based on the feedback from the other member. After fixing, they will go through another round of the review process until the feature is ready to be pushed to the master branch.
- Ongoing adjustments
  - Online group messenger (WeChat)
  - As group memebers work on to achieve weekly target, there might be potential issues that require immediate modification in implementation or weekly goal. These issues will be ongoingly monitored and discussed through online group messenger. 
  - If immediate change in the direction of the project is needed, additional group meeting will be scheduled with priority. The decisions on minor issues will be made through the group chat.

#### Artifacts

**To-Do lists, "Trello"**

We are using "Trello" for managing weekly workload, assigning work to team members, and tracking issues. Trello provides a digital board which is highly customizable, and it helps us to list our unfinished tasks, finished tasks, and identify tasks needed to be reviewed. We will organize the work based on scrum principles and prioritize certain tasks based on partner needs.

**Prioritizing tasks**

We will prioritize our tasks when we hold our first meeting once the deliverable started. We will mark the most important tasks and let all of our team members work for them first.

**Assigning tasks to team members**

We split our team into 3 subgroups: Front end(Canvas), Front end(User pages) and Back end.

Each of the subgroups will work on the most important tasks of their part listed in "Trello" and to the least important.


#### Deployment and Github Workflow

Before we started the actual coding, we had a group meeting to split our team into subgroups, each working on one major part of the project (the breakdown is detailed below). To ensure the completeness of each part within the desired time, we have at least two people working on the same category so that they can reach out and offer help to one another.

We split our project into three parts:
1) Front-end(Fabric) Members: Junkai, Jay, and Frank
Junkai, Jay, and Frank worked on building the FBC application page, where users put stickies onto the virtual canvas.
2) Front-end(User pages) Members: Xuhui and Xinyi
Xuhui and Xinyi worked on building registration, log in, user profile, as well as the library page for users/managers to keep track of and access all canvas projects that they have participated in, if applicable.
3) Back-end Members: Fanxuan and Luya
Fanxuan and Luya worked on back-end development to receive data sent from the front-end, interpret the meaning of the data, manipulate the data to get relevant information that needs to be updated on the database, and send data back to the front-end for displaying purposes.
Our database is designed to store user information, canvas information, and the relationship between users and canvases.

We split our work this way so that not too many members are working on the same part of our project which helps us avoid conflicts on our code as well as maximize efficiency.

We create sub-branches on Git based on the functionality for tracking purpose which is explained below.

- Front-end

  - comment
    the comment system under each stickies

  - canvas+fabric
    user library page including ejs and css, and FBC canvas page

  - manage-user-validate-email

    regex check when entering user's email

  - multiuser
    to perform multi user synchronization 

- Back-end

  - backend
    back-end files, database, and other merged front-end pages in ejs version for testing the correctness of whether front-end and back-end are linked properly

We started our deliverable by creating the comment branch, where our front end and back end group work on the comment system of stickies together. (Backend need to store stickies' comments information, while front end need to test all possible actions for comment) 

Then, we added multiuser branch to implement multi user synchronization. Once finished, we created a pull request and had the group member that also worked on this branch review it and merged to master.

Later, we merged the comment branch to master as well by also creating pull request and had the member of the same reviewed the work.

Once we finished testing our master, we started merging canvas+fabric and manage-user-validate-email into master as well, both branches are for the view and functionality on the library and canvas page. When we merged, we created a pull request and let the other member reviewed it.

For deployment tools, we have node.js for local and heroku for online. 
We use node.js because our project does not have intensive operations but only connections between server and clients. Node.js as a platform that is capable of handling a huge number of simultaneous connections best suits for our need.
We use heroku not only because it is widely popular but also the fact that it is easy to set up by simply pushing our codes to the heroku git repository. 

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

**Goal:**
For Deliverable 3, our main goal is to finish building our minimum viable product which multiple users can access the website at the same time, as well as admin able to send invitation and approve users who want to register.

Tasks (Ranking from the most important to the least):
1) **Admin page**

An admin page for our partner to approve/decline the users who want to register, invite users to become a manager, and manage all users in the website, etc. So our website can finally be running as it should, since it is a private website which requires admin's approval/invitation to use the website.

2) **Multiple user synchronization**

Multiple users can access the same canvas page at the same time, and once a user performs any kind of valid action, such as adding or removing a sticky, rearranging it to a different box, the other users will be able to see it.

3) **Copy feature on the library page**

A copy feature is implemented so the manager and admin can now copy an existing canvas if they need.

4) **Reallocating and improving view**

We reallocated many of our buttons and improved many of our functions so either they became more user friendly or looked better, such as adding a regex check when entering an email, move users directly to log in page if they have not yet signed in to the website, improving the view of creating a sticky, etc.

#### Artifacts

**Sketch**

Since we want our work to satisfy as an MVP, we want our work to be as user friendly as possible.

To achieve that, we drew sketches for our group members so that have an idea how they should place the buttons.

**Admin page**

We will build an admin page where admin can approve/decline the users who want to register, invite users to become a manager, and manage all users in the website, etc. This is needed to present our project idea because our product is meant to be a private page, therefore an admin page is essential as a key component of the MVP.

**Multiple user synchronization**

We will implement multiple user synchronization for our project since FBC is designed for a group of colleagues to discuss their ideas.
