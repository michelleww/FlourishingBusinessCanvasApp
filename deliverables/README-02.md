> _Note:_ This document is intended to be relatively short. Be concise and precise. Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of your application and is non-technical. 

## Description 
 * Provide a high-level description of your application and it's value from an end-user's perspective

   **High-level description**

Our website provides FBC template and online access to the users. Users who are enrolled in the same canvas are able to edit the canvas at the same time. Besides the regular FBC features such as adding, removing and rearranging stickies, changing the name of the FBC or the owner, users can also search or comment any specific stickies. As well as exporting the FBCs into pdf format.

After users successfully signed up their accounts, they can be logged in as **manager**, if they have received our partner's invitation email. Or a regular **user**, if they are invited by their managers. 

A **manager** has access to managing (a.k.a. creating & deleting) canvases, managing (a.k.a. adding and removing) users of each canvases. All users (**managers** & regular **users**) are able to edit the canvases that they are enrolled in.

â€‹	**Value from end-user's perspective**

The main value from an end-user's perspective is that it is a lot more time saving to invite their colleagues to use our online FBC template to work on their business ideas than to build a traditional physical FBC in their office. Since the FBCs are likely to be modified often and the fact that users might not be able to be together at the same physical space all the time, by having a cloud version of FBC, **users will be able to view/change/discuss it even if they are at different places**. Also, the physical canvas has limitation on the amount of data (stickies) to be shared. Besides that, it is hard to rearrange or remove some of the stickies when it reaches a certain quantity. **Our website extends the amount of data stored significantly and make the process easier and neater**. Furthermore, it is time consuming to search for a specific sticky on a physical FBC. The search function in our website solves this issue. Additionally, the comment system under each stickies is a place for users to **save their thoughtful discussions of specific stickies so that it might come useful later as their FBC progresses**.  

 * What is the problem you're trying to solve?

 * Is there any context required to understand **why** the application solves this problem?

The contest is that users are now using physical FBC to solve their need. The main problem about having it physical is that users can no longer access the FBC once they are out of where the FBC is placed, and it is unrealistic to have a copy and distribute it to every member of the group not only because it is costly but also the FBC is likely to be changed frequently and thus hard to keep everyone informed and updated. The users would choose our product to solve the problem because of the functionalities we provide compared to the physical model such as quick setup of the FBC, multiple access for users to view and modify the canvas online simultaneously, tracked past discussions, and ability to sort and search the model efficiently. 

## Key Features
 * Described the key features in the application that the user can access

Additionally, when user **single click** a sticky, under the header they will be an extra box displaying all the stickies under the box where the current selected sticky is in. This is useful when there are too many stickies in a box.
