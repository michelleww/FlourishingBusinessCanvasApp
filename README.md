# Flourishing Business Canvas/Team 9
CSC301, Winter 2019, team project.



**Log in/Sign up page**

This is the first page users will reach in our website. 

Our website is designed to be a private page, therefore, a user should receive our partner(admin)'s invitation email in order to sign up for an account. 

For testing purposes, enter 22@q as email with password 123 will log in to a regular user page.

Enter h@p as email and magic as password will log in to a manager page.

**Library page(Manager)**

Click any FBC shown under the header will move user to the main FBC application page of a specific FBC.

On the right side of the header there three buttons, **Manage users**, **Manage canvas** and **Profile**.

By clicking **Manage users**, the list of canvases that the manager has currently, as well as the users of each canvases will be shown in the pop up window. Manager can **add** users to any canvas by clicking the add button under the specific canvas and enter their emails, or **remove** users from a canvas by checking the users under that canvas and click remove.

By clicking **Manage canvas**, the manager can **add** new canvas by entering the title of the new canvas, or **remove** previous canvases by checking the canvases and the remove button.

By clicking **Profile**, manager will be moved to the profile page.

**Library page(User)**

All functionalities are the same as **Library page(Manager)** except that a user can not manage users or canvas.

**Profile page**

Users can modify their information in this page and click **Save changes** for it to take effect. However, email cannot be changed.

When clicking **Want to change password?**, users can change their password by entering their old and new password.

**Main FBC application page**

When users are successfully logged in to our website, through the library page they will be able to move to the canvas page.

Under our header "Flourishing Business Canvas", we can notice there is **left arrow button** which is for users to go back to the library page. 

Besides the arrow button, we have an input box where users can enter the content they want and create a new sticky by pressing the "**New Sticky**" button.

Once a sticky is created, users can drag it to their desired boxes. The sticky will automatically positioned meaning if it is dragged to the middle of two boxes, it will be moved in to the box that is the closest to it.

User can also **double click** a sticky to modify its **color**, **content**, add **comment** or **delete** it entirely.

Additionally, when user **single click** a sticky, under the header they will be an extra box displaying all the stickies under the box where the current selected sticky is in. This is useful when there are too many stickies in a box.

Furthermore, on the right side of the header, users can input the **first name** and **last name** of the creator of this page, **export** the FBC and **search** within the canvas. For now, search function can only display the stickies that has the keyword under the search bar but not able to transition to them.
