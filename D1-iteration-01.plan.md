### Team Rules

The key to our teamâ€™s working culture would be **transparency**. The atmosphere where each member can express his/her thoughts and communicate open-mindedly is ensured. Scrum master makes sure that members are informed of important issues and changes in timely manner.

#### Communications

- **Daily online discussion** if any team member encounters technical issues (Messenger)
- **Weekly in-person discussion with TAs** during tutorials
- **Weekly in-person meeting with partners** The progress of the project will be presented to the partner during the meeting in forms of screenshots and demonstration.

#### Meetings

The **scrum master** is the moderator for internal meetings who will keep track of attendance of the team and discuss with absent members to any of the group activities.

##### Conflict Resolution

Here are some examples of possible conflicts that would happen in the team and our solutions to them.

##### Indecisions

We will **analyze the issue in advance** as a group to make sure every member understands the underlying concept and **brainstorm all possible solutions**. Then, **voting** will be held and the option chosen by the majority will be our final decision.

##### Non-responsive team members

- We will **send messages directly** to them and **contact the member who is the closest to him/her**.
- We will **have conversation in a private manner** to find out if the member has any personal issues that cannot be publicized. We will offer help as a team if any support is needed.

##### Members keep missing deadline

- **Lower the workload** assigned to the member.
- Depending on the **evaluation of the difficulty of the task**, give a reasonable extension on deadline.
- **Redistribute the roles and responsibilities** to other members who have capacity to support.

##### Digressions and tangents

- Product manager **communicates with the partner** to find out if there is room for flexibility.
- Negotiate with the partner to **adjust the direction of the project** in case the objective of the product is not aligned with the original goal.
     

#### Events

We have two weekly meetings.

- **Monday at tutorial room**:

- - Check the progress of the weekly plan (how much of the weekly goal is completed, what needs to be improved, etc.)
    - Set up plan/goal for the coming week

- **Thursday 4-5 pm at the study room** we booked. During that time, two meetings will be held - partner meeting and internal group meeting.

- - Partner meeting: Report the progress and discuss continuously on the project requirements or modification on specifications.

    - Internal group meeting (followed after the partner meeting):

    - - Understand and interpret needs of the partner.
        - Discuss any issues regarding the weekly plan for the group and derive solutions/modifications if needed.
        - Create and assign weekly goals for individual members.
             

##### Artifacts

We will be using **Trello** for managing weekly workload, assigning work to team members, and tracking issues. Trello provides a digital board which is highly customizable, and it helps us to list our unfinished tasks, finished tasks, and identify tasks needed to be reviewed. We will organize the work based on scrum principles and prioritize certain tasks based on partner needs.
