# Note for further development

1. Change the database URL in `connect.js`. (need to be mongodb)
2. Follow the example in line 349 and then fill in the email 
   related info in the empty string (line 342) in `views/manager.ejs`
3. Follow the example in line 289 and then fill in the email 
   related info in the empty string (line 281) in `views/admin.ejs`

Technical:
- we are using Node JS to serve as our backend.
- we are using MongoDB to serve as our database.
