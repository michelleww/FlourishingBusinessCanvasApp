## Feedback
Product
- Strong Q1 - problem and context are clear
- User definition could be diversified and strengthened to include goals, frustrations, needs
- Comprehensive technical explanation however the architecture diagram is non-standard/unintuitive
- Generally speaking, interface/API/component testing comes first or alongside functional/system testing
- Solid highlights - it's clear you're approaching this from the perspective of user value

Plan
- Unclear what the communication expectation is amongst team members - 24 hours, 48 hours, etc.
- Would like more detail on how your team prioritizes vis-a-vis partner needs

Overall Quality
- Left in template component in product.md
- Good use of MD styling in general
- Weird indentation hierarchy throughout the plan
